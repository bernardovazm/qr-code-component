-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

###### Containing comments, tips and reminders cleaned out from the code

Name mangling convention example:

```html
<article class="card">
	...
	<div class="card__description"></div>
</article>
```

#### CSS reset

Sizing made simpler:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Remove default spacing
Force styling of type through styling, rather than elements:

```css
* {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	font: inherit;
}
```

Dark mode user-agent-styles:

```css
html {
	color-scheme: dark light;
}
```

Minimum body height:

```css
body {
	min-height: 100vh;
}
```

Responsive images/videos:

```css
img,
picture,
svg,
video {
	display: block;
	max-width: 100%;
}
```

ðŸ’¡ Tip for importing fonts: &lt;link&gt; performs better than @import. Check [stevesouders](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/) post to read more about it.

### Continued development

There are many areas I wish to improve, from SEO, accessibility, better and more concise CSS, and even writing better git commit messages. Some ideas of what could be improved for this project:

-   [ ] Use a pre-processor, such as Sass;
-   [ ] SEO;
-   [ ] Implement Dark Theme;
